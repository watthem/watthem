# About Matthew

## I'm a reliable, organized, and hard-working independent contractor.

See my [freelance services](https://matthewhendricks.net//services/) or [examples of my work](https://matthewhendricks.net//work/).

I have worked with smaller start-ups and independent consulting gigs. I've also had the good fortune of working for technology giants:

- **Ookla** - (the outstanding cats behind [Speedtest.net](http://speedtest.net/))
- **Microsoft** - (shortly until Covid-19)

I am proud of the accomplishments I have had on the teams I've been a part of and I am considered an influence of high quality and new standards.

## I've been successful figuring out little ways to work on big problems.

Recently, I've learned to develop a new perspective on work, which has helped me focus on what is working and how we can make those things better.

- Observing without judgment â€” pay attention to what keeps a job in the right direction.
- Documenting everything â€” refine what works well.
- Communicating with empathy â€” be specific, realistic, and prompt.

## I am currently Living in Seattle, WA
